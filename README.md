# Quantum Computing Things
Basic programs relating to quantum information science topics
## CHSH Game
Implements both the classical and quantum versions
### Classical 
The optimal strategy is to choose one number to always return before the game starts (75% win rate)
### Quantum
If Alice and Bob share an entangled pair, they can increase their win chance (85.4%)
## Grover's Algorithm
Search algorithm that offers quadratic speedup over a classical search algorithm for unsorted data
