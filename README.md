# Quantum Computing Things
Basic programs relating to quantum information science topics
## CHSH Game
Implements both the classical and quantum versions
### Classical 
The optimal strategy is to choose one number to always return before the game starts (75% win rate)
### Quantum
If Alice and Bob share an entangled pair, they can increase their win chance (85.4%)
## Grover's Algorithm
Search algorithm that offers quadratic speedup over a classical search algorithm for unsorted data
## Shor's Algorithm
Classical simulation of Shor's Algorithm, a factoring algorithm that uses Euler's Algorithm and is much faster in quantum. Shor's runs in polynomial time, while the best classical factoring algorithms only do sub-exponential time
